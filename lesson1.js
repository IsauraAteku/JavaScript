//Variables

//Task 1: 
var petDog = "Rex";
var petCat = "Pepper"
console.log(petDog)
console.log(petCat)
console.log("My pet dog's name is: ", petDog);

//Data types
/*seven types:- 
1. Number: numerical values
- limited

123 =      number
123.456 =  decimal
2 + 4 =    addition
2-5 =      subtraction
4*5 =      multiplication
20/5 =     division
4**2 =     exponential calc (power of)
9 % 8 =    Modulus/ remainder after division
2*(4+8)=   parenthisis (sets the order of operation)

2. String:  text values. 
- charcters must be enclosed in single or double quotes
- collection of char enclosed by single or double quotes

'' or " " =   empty string
'hello there!'
'hello there!123'

DELIMETERS - characters when using single or double quotes to surround string values. this is because they're used to delimit a given string value from the rest of the code.


3. Boolean: 
- has only 2 values: True or False
e.g 1>2 =       FALSE
1 < 2 =         TRUE
1 == 2 =        FALSE
100 == "100" =  TRUE (only checks for value)
100 === "100" = FALSE (checks for both the value and data type) *STRICT EQUALITY OPERATOR
1 != 1 =        FALSE
1 !== '1' =     true (*STRICT INEQUALITY OPERATOR) **Checks for both data type and value


4. Bigint: 
- like a Xlarge box that can accomodate a greater range of numbers.

5. Null: 
- represents absence of a value

6. Undefined: 
-represents a variable not assigned a value

7. Symbol:
- used as a unique identifier

/* ORDER OF PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY

- Presidence = set of rules that determines which operator to be evaluated first.
- Operator Associativity = determines how the precedence works when the code uses operators with the same precedence.
       are two kinds:

             e.g 5 > 4 > 3;

             -the 5 > 4 is evaluated first (to `true`), 
             then true > 3 is evaluated to `false`,

//EXERCISE : Advanced use of operators

/*
Task 1: Using the logical && operator
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

*/

console.log("Mid-level skills: ", score > 0 && score < 10);



//ANOTHER WAY WITHOUT AND OPERATOR
var score = 8
console.log("Mid-level skills: " , 0 > score < 10 );



/*
Task 2: Using the logical || operator
Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.

You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.

Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

Complete the task using the following steps:

Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.

Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.

Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true".

*/

var timeRemaining = 0
var energy = 10

//Try changing the timeRemaining variable to anything above 0 and then see how it affects the result.

/*
Task 3: Using the modulus operator, %, to test if a given number is odd
You need to code a small program that takes a number 
and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).


*/

//TIPS
/* To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:

The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.

The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.

The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. Note: executing this code will return a number.

The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. Note: executing this code will also return a number.

The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test1 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, this: test1 == 0.

The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test2 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.

Run console log two times after you've set the variables:

The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1

The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2

Note: The output to the console should be as follows:

Is 2 an even number? true

Is 5 an even number? false

*/

Task 6: Use the += operator to accumulate values in a variable
